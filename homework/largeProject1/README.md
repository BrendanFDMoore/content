## Putting It All Together

So far, we've discussed a lot of complicated ideas and concepts, and it's important to ensure that we
really grasp the lessons so that we have a solid foundation to work off of. This Project will tackle the following topics:

* Functional Programming
* Callbacks
* Promises
* React
    * Components (Class and Functional)
    * State
    * Routing
    * PropTypes
    * Testing

#### The assignment is as follows:

[Using any endpoints from this link, or from anywhere for that matter,](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
create a react application that fulfills the requested features and criteria:

1. This react application should have a home page that is situated on the applications base route
2. This homepage should have a search bar, with a button that says something like "Go" or "Search" next to it
3. By default, below the search bar you should see nothing
4. When the user types something into the search bar, and the button next to it pressed, an API request should go out
5. If this API request returns a result, the results of that request should be displayed below the search bar as a list
6. If the API returns no result, the user should see a message that says something along the lines of "Sorry, no results found"
7. If you click on any of the results in the list, additional information for that item should be visible on a separate route
8. At least 3 tests should be written for your application as a whole - they don't need to be very clever,
but you should be getting comfortable writing them


Will provide a repository of a lesson plan that should cover the fundamentals.
