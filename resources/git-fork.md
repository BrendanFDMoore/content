# Git: Forking a repository

> _Ah, the lifeBranching, committing, pushing, merging... modifying code to my hearts' content... breathing life into features like some sort of magician or squashing bugs like an exterminator. Bliss. Until..._

```bash
! [remote rejected] master -> master (protected branch hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:some-account/some-repo.git'
```

☹️

When working with code, there are times when you will want to modify code that resides in a repository that is not under your control. You might want to introduce features that are outside the scope for the project. You may want to build something completely unrelated and just use the repository as a starting point. Maybe it just needs a bug fix, but the maintainer has abandoned the repository. 

For all these times and more (later), there's **Forking**!

## What is a Fork?

Forking is creating a new copy of the entire repository. This might sound like `git clone`, and in some senses it is. The difference is in where the new copy reside. A "clone" typically refers to a _local_ copy of some remote repository. A _fork_, in contrast, is a second *remote* repository distinct from the original it copies.
